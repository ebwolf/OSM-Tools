NOTE: I need to clean this up and update what I've been working on for the past nine months. 
I've been too busy coding to fix my Windows installation of git...

OSM-Tools

This is a set of tools specfically designed for working with the OSM Full Planet
file. The tools are designed to work with a fairly stock Python install, including
the version installed with ArcGIS 9.3.1.

OSMReader.py - a class for transparently handling the OSM Full Planet which has
    some technical challenges relative to the regular OSM Planet file. Primarily,
    Full Planet is big. As of 2011-04-18, the file is about 473GB uncompressed
    and 26GB compressed in bz2. It also does not have any line breaks.

    OSMReader tranparently handles text .osm, .bz2 and .gz formats.
    it provides two means of traversing the file - tag by tag and object by object

    All other scripts here depend on this class.

osm_chunker.py - simply runs through the OSM file and creates 4-5 new ones 
    containing just the nodes, just the ways, just the changesets, etc.
    This helps reduce the size of the files necessary for the other scripts.

osm_fpextract.py - works on smaller files but runs out of memory on big files.
    takes two passes to generate a spatial and/or temporal extract of full planet

osm2sqlite.py - imports the specified planet file into an sqlite3 database

osm2fgdb.py - imports the specified file into ArcGIS File Geodatabase
